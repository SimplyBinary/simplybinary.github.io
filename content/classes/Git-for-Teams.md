## This isn't Your Average Git Seminar

From the get-go you'll be working hands on with git. The material is presented with short videos that clearly explain topics using graphics and animations to help visualize complex or confusing concepts. You'll clone a repository with exercises and problems to solve. If you get stuck we'll be right there to help.

It doesn't matter if you attend solo or with your entire team, you'll get just as much out of Git for Teams either way. Most of the concepts, patterns, and practices that we'll cover can be implemented one at a time by individuals, but they really shine when used together.

All you'll need is your laptop you use with Git regularly and a recent version of <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3" target="_blank">VirtualBox 4.3</a>. Participants should be comfortable using the command line and have a basic understanding of, cloning, branching, committing, and pushing.

The one day class includes morning and afternoon refreshments and runs from 9:00am to 5:00pm. Greenville, SC has an amazing downtown with many great resturants, shops, and parks. For this reason we don't provide a catered lunch and instead encourage participants to explore some of what downtown Greenville has to offer. Our team is almost as experienced in dining in downtown Greenville as they are in Git and will be happy to point participants in the right direction for the cusine of their choosing. A great lunch can be had downtown within walking distance of the seminar for less than $10.

Early bird pricing is still available for only $319 per person! Be sure to <a href="mailto:training@simmplybinary.com">contact us</a> about team discounts if multiple people would like to attend from the same organization.
